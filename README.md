# DataStructures_Algorithms_CS260_LinkedList
In Lab 3 we learned about making linked lists. This program we made ways for the user to append nodes to the list, prepend nodes to the list, print everything on the linked list, remove a node, and search a node in the linked list. The back ground to this project was that we were creating solutions  so that we could keep track of charity auctions.
